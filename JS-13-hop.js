/*
Do you remember the game of hop? 

Get a  number between 2 and 6 from the user (you can use prompt and alert in this practice), then log from 1 to 200 in the console.
It is just like the game of hop, whatever number the user enters, the numbers will be printed accordingly.

Example: If the user enters the number 3, the numbers will be printed like this:
1, 2, hop, 4, 5, hop, 7, 8, hop, 10 ..., 200 

*/
//! Answer:
let userNumber = parseInt(prompt("pleas enter number between 2 to 6"));

if (userNumber >= 2 && userNumber < 6) {
  for (let i = 0; i <= 200; i++) {
    if (i % userNumber === 0) {
      console.log("hop");
    } else {
      console.log(i);
    }
  }
} else {
  prompt("please inter correct number");
}
